# CODSOFT Virtual Internship Projects 🚀

During my virtual internship at CODSOFT, I developed three projects using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## Projects 🛠️

### 1. ATM Interface 🏦
A simple yet functional ATM simulation that allows users to perform basic banking operations like checking balance, withdrawing cash, and changing PIN. This project demonstrates the use of classes and objects to encapsulate banking operations.

### 2. Number Game 🎮
An interactive game that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project showcases the application of control structures and user input handling in Java, along with basic game logic.

### 3. Student Grade Calculator 📚
An application designed to calculate and display student grades based on their scores. It takes input for various subjects, processes the data, and provides a summary of results. This project highlights the use of arrays and methods for data processing.

## Technologies Used 💻
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## Getting Started 🏁
To run these projects, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory to execute the main class.

Feel free to explore and modify the projects to enhance your understanding of Java and OOP concepts!
